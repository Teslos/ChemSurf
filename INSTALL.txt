To Install ChemSurf program you need TQ-interface license.
Copy tq.dll file to directory were the program is.

Compile the fortran file ChemSurf.for with fortran compiler using build.bat.
Currently only Intel's ifort and Compaq's df fortran  are working with
tq.lib library. Current version of TQ wants also license file locally in the
same directory were the program is installed.
